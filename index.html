    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Empowering Households. Transforming Lives.

Founded by Precious Radebe, our training initiative was born from a deeply personal mission — to create opportunities where none previously existed<!-- //Add read more button from here --> read more... Inspired by her parents and elderly relatives who were denied access to formal education and skills development, Precious envisioned a space where domestic workers and gardeners could unlock their potential and reshape their futures.

We are a community-focused training school dedicated to upskilling domestic workers and gardeners, equipping them with practical, in-demand skills that increase their employability, earning potential, and ability to start their own small businesses. Whether it’s advanced cleaning techniques, home management, gardening best practices, or entrepreneurial guidance, we aim to instill confidence and competence in every trainee.
