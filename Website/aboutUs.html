      <h2>Who We Are</h2>

      <!-- Description of the organization's background and purpose -->
      <p>
        <strong>Empowering the Nation</strong> was established in 2022 by <strong>Precious Radebe</strong> to provide
        professional skills training to domestic workers and gardeners in Johannesburg.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspired by her parents and elders who lacked opportunities to upskill, Precious built a program that helps learners
        become more marketable, earn higher wages, and even launch their own small businesses.
      </p>

      <!-- Highlighting key achievement -->
      <p class="note">
        Hundreds of learners have already completed our six month Learnerships and six-week Short Skills Training Programs.
      </p>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Employers gain confidence and value from skilled staff; employees gain dignity, mobility,
          and better pay. Everyone wins when skills grow.
